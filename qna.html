             <label for="first" class="question">How can I rebuild my self-esteem after emotional setbacks?</label>
             <div class="answer">
                <p>Rebuilding self-esteem starts with acknowledging the setback without judgment. Begin by practicing self-compassion; speak to yourself as you would to a close friend. Set small, achievable goals that help you regain a sense of accomplishment. Surround yourself with positive influences and people who lift you up. Gradually work on shifting negative self-talk into constructive affirmations. Remember, self-worth isn't based on success or failure but on your inherent value as a person.</p>

            <div class="answer">
               <p>Start by prioritizing self-care—this can include exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate sleep. Practice mindfulness and meditation to stay grounded in the present moment. Establish a support network of friends, family, or professionals with whom you can talk openly. Engage in activities that bring you joy and purpose. Limit your consumption of negative media, and consider journaling to process your emotions. If needed, seek professional help without hesitation, as therapy can be an important tool.</p>

        <label for="third" class="question">How do I navigate the emotional challenges of motherhood? </label>
        <div class="answer">
           <p>Motherhood is a deeply rewarding but challenging journey. It’s essential to give yourself grace and let go of the idea of being a "perfect" mother. Establish a routine that includes time for self-care, even if it’s just a few moments a day. Talk openly with other mothers or support groups, as shared experiences can ease feelings of isolation. Trust your instincts, but don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. Remember, emotional resilience grows as you learn and adapt with each phase of motherhood.</p>

        <div class="answer">
           <p>Struggles with body image often stem from societal pressures and unrealistic beauty standards. The key to overcoming this is shifting your focus from appearance to functionality—appreciate what your body can do. Challenge negative thoughts by reframing them with positive affirmations about your strengths and abilities. Engage in activities that make you feel good physically, whether it’s dancing, yoga, or walking. Self-love is a journey; remind yourself that you’re worthy, regardless of appearance.</p>

    <div class="answer">
       <p>Caregiving is a noble yet demanding role. It’s crucial to recognize that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and exhausted. Set realistic expectations for yourself and don't feel guilty about asking for help. Make time for activities that rejuvenate you, whether it’s a hobby or simply rest. Establish boundaries to protect your mental and emotional well-being, and seek out caregiver support groups where you can share your experiences and learn from others. Self-care is not selfish; it’s necessary.</p>

    <div class="answer">
       <p>Handling toxic relationships starts with recognizing the patterns—manipulation, emotional abuse, or constant negativity. Begin by setting clear boundaries that protect your emotional space. Communicate your needs assertively but calmly. If the relationship continues to harm you, consider distancing yourself or cutting ties if necessary. Focus on nurturing relationships that respect your boundaries, and surround yourself with those who uplift rather than drain you.</p>

       <p>Feeling lost is a part of the self-discovery journey. Begin by exploring activities that genuinely interest you. Consider what brings you joy and where your natural talents lie. Reflect on moments in your life when you felt fulfilled or inspired. It’s okay if your purpose isn’t clear right away—embrace the process of trial and error. Journaling can help clarify your thoughts, and talking to mentors or life coaches may guide you toward deeper insights about yourself.</p>
